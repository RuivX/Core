# Core
Discord bot

# What is?
Core is a project of mine that since I started using the platform: "Discord". I wanted to do it, a bot for Discord.

# Why did I want to do that?
I don't know how to explain it but I will try... The first bot I saw and found impressive was Loritta. And I was like, "I can do that too." and ... I did, I mean ... it's not as impressive as even Loritta but ... I'm trying to leave Core as a bot that almost everyone who uses Discord knows, and that a lot of people put it on their servers. That's it HAHA.
