# Core
Discord bot

# Version
3.0.0

# What is?
Core is a project of mine that since I started using the platform: "Discord". I wanted to do it, a bot for Discord.

# Why I want to do this?
I don't know how to explain it but I will try... The first bot I saw and found impressive was Loritta. And I was like, "I can do that too." and ... I did, I mean ... it's not as impressive as even Loritta but ... I'm trying to leave Core as a bot that almost everyone who uses Discord knows, and that a lot of people put it on their servers. That's it HAHA.

# Update
I recently spent several days updating the Core, it's almost completely over, but there are some things I still want to change.

# What has changed in this update?

I added the "Events" folder, made the commands more organized, added Aliases to the commands, added the "guildMemberRemove" event and other things (I recently removed from the Core repository, the ` package-lock.json` because I found it unnecessary to keep them here).
